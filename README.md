Welcome to XCC, a preprocessor adding conditional compilation support to XAML files. Enable XCC in your project by installing a tiny NuGet package. Supporting *Windows Universal*, *WPF*, *Managed C++*, and *Xamarin Forms* projects. Other project types have not been tested.

**Note**: XCC is a proof of concept. No guarantees whatsoever, use at your own risk.
